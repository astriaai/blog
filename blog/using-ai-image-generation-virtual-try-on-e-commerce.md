## What is Virtual Try-On?

Virtual try-on technology allows customers to visualize how a product, such as clothing or accessories, would look on them without physically trying it on. As [Google](https://blog.google/products/shopping/ai-virtual-try-on-google-shopping/) defines it, virtual try-on is "a way to see how products look on you or in your space using your phone's camera or webcam." This technology leverages AI to generate images of customers wearing specific garments, creating a more engaging and interactive shopping experience.

The process behind virtual try-on technology typically involves the following steps, as explained by [Rapidops](https://www.rapidops.com/ai-tracker/virtual-try-ons/):

1.  Capturing a customer's image or using a pre-existing photo
2.  Detecting and segmenting the customer's body or face
3.  Superimposing the product image onto the customer's image
4.  Rendering the final image with the product virtually "tried on"

Virtual try-on offers numerous benefits for both e-commerce businesses and customers. As highlighted by [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/blog/e-commerce-and-retail-with-generative-ai), virtual try-on can:

- Increase customer engagement and time spent on the website
- Reduce product returns by providing a more accurate representation of how the product looks on the customer
- Boost conversion rates and sales by instilling confidence in the customer's purchase decision
- Enhance the overall customer experience by offering a more personalized and interactive shopping journey
